    <div><img src="/img/Me and Lucy.JPEG"><p>Hi there! I hope you had fun with my guessing game. As you learned about me from playing it, I am a native of Colorado, I left it for awhile to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, and now I am back here in a home of my own with my German Shepherd, Lucy!  I was most recently a paramedic for several years, and am making a career transition, now, into computer software engineering! The text you are reading at this moment, and the webpage it is displayed on, was all developed and written by me as part of my coursework at Code Fellows, where I am learning how to develop software!</p></div>
